# Civilian AOI Backlog

Use this when expanding `training/replay_pack/non_demo_eval.jsonl`.

Rule:
- public civilian lifeline
- macro visible in Sentinel
- current/recent conflict context allowed
- no mixed-use military ports
- no fuel depots
- no crossing-gate route intel

## Current shortlist

### Go now

#### Port Sudan Aid Hub
- asset type: `container_port`
- why:

### Hold; retry with different timestamps

#### Chornomorsk Grain Port
- asset type: `grain_port`
- why:
  - civilian grain/export artery
  - good category fit
  - first local probe returned near-total cloud on both dates
- dates probed:
  - baseline probe: `2025-12-14T08:57:36Z`
  - current probe: `2026-01-08T09:07:47Z`
- status: `hold_cloud`

#### Pivdennyi Export Port
- asset type: `container_port`
- why:
  - major civilian export artery
  - first local probe returned near-total cloud on both dates
- dates probed:
  - baseline probe: `2025-12-14T08:57:36Z`

### Keep out for now

#### Hodeidah / Ras Issa Port Lane
- why:
  - humanitarian relevance, yes
  - dual-use risk too high for first Blackline lane
  - local probe was usable, but category safety not clean enough
- status: `avoid_dual_use`

#### Gaza Crossing Gates
- why:
  - humanitarian importance, yes
  - macro Sentinel signal too weak for honest first-pass labels
  - too close to route/gate intelligence
- status: `avoid_visibility_and_sensitivity`
